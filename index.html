		<pre id="s">Draw a digit!</pre>
		<pre>Please try to follow these rules for the best results:
- draw the digit as big as possible, with big and long lines
- draw the curves smooth without peeks
- draw the straight lines straight
- draw the peeks sharp and well defined
- draw the 4 as it is on your keyboard
- if the program keeps not catching the digit try drawing at different speeds/sizes<pre>
